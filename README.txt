Aside from the lateness of the assignment due to the virtual machine crash,
this assignment is simply a "home webpage". There's a very crude homepage (a directory, index.html) with my name, a (fake) picture, and links to a short biography (bio.html) and my CV (resume.html). Overall, a very explorational project and useful for learning introdutory HTML5 and CSS.
