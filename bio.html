<h2>The abridged version</h2>
<body>Greetings! My name is Joshua Akira Hartigan. I was born in Saint Louis, Missouri and grew up in Potosi, MO and for the last eight years, in Columbia, MO. I'm a sophomore studying electrical engineering (and tentatively applied math) at Tufts University in Medford, MA. My hobbies include drawing/sketching, reading (mainly historical non-fiction and classics), running (I plan to run the Boston Marathon in 2015...fingers crossed that I survive), and hiking.</body>
